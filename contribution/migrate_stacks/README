Look at the fasta file, these files came straight out of the stacks pipeline,
I can get the pipeline, if you need it.
then execute 

for Peter Beerli's stacks2migrate.py use:

cat example.fasta | python stacks2mig.py 

this will generate a migrate infile


for Paul Maier's fasta2genotype.py use

<this will come -- I need to contact him about the additional files>
